# pet-i3-mk2

This is an example action that slices [this object from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2177951).

To try this example, put the contents of this directory into a new repository that has GitHub Actions enabled. When the action has finished running, it will drop .gcode files into your repository.

Steps: 

* create a [new repository on github](https://github.com/new)

* copy these files to a new directory / your new repository

* follow the new repository instructions and add a new file to run the workflow: e.g. `git init` && `git add .` && `git commit -a -m 'Initial commit'` && `git remote add origin git@github.com:example/example-repository` && `git push -u origin master`
